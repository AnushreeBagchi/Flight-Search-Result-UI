# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
I would add the following
1. I would run es-list and fix all the errors.
2. State management - Redux for the state management and making it more cleaner and extensible.
3. Add a footer at the end to show the selection.
4. Add React router for the routing.
5. Add unit tests


### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
1. The styling looks almost similar to the design provided.
2. Selection 
    - User can select only one airline
    - User can toggle the selection
    - Badge appears on top indicating selection
    - Selecting another airline unselects the selected one.


### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
1. Styling and grids - Reading through the backpack framework.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
1. I have assumed that the time did not need to be converted to the user time zone. Some guidance on the expectation would have been nice.
